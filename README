CGI:IRC - http://cgiirc.sourceforge.net/
----------------------------------------

CGI:IRC is a Perl/CGI program that lets you access IRC from a web browser, it
is designed to be flexible and has many uses such as an IRC gateway for an IRC
network, a chat-room for a website or to access IRC when stuck behind a
restrictive firewall.

This is a very quick guide to CGI:IRC, you will find more documentation in the
docs directory and on the website.

Requirements
------------

1. Ability to run CGI scripts using Perl 5.004 or greater
2. UNIX based system
3. Acceptable use policy allows access to IRC

Generally if you pay your host enough they will let you run CGI:IRC, but beware
it does use a lot of memory because each user uses a web server process and a
perl process. This is due to the stream based nature and the fact most
webservers are designed to serve static content.

Installing
----------
These are very simple instructions, see the website for more in depth
instructions.

1. Edit the cgiirc.config or cgiirc.config.full (if you use cgiirc.config.full
   make sure to rename it to cgiirc.config).
2. Copy or upload all the files to your cgi-bin directory, and put the images
   directory in the correct location (may or may not be inside the cgi-bin
   directory).
   If you don't want to the docs directory does not need to be uploaded to the
   server.
3. Check that all the files have the correct permissions and so on
4. Visit the location you installed irc.cgi to.

If it doesn't work see the website as it has answers to common problems.

Support
-------

CGI:IRC has a mailing list for support questions and anything else:
