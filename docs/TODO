TODO
----

bugs:
- horzontal scrolling with really long lines

features:
- adding code to check for op to add op/voice/deop/devoice/ban/kick to userlist
- scrolling locks if the window is scrolled upwards
- topic bar
  this is going to be difficult as it comes along with wanting to reposition
  the tab bar as well, i'm not sure of the best way of doing this (and
  interfaces are already too messy).
- 0.4 had a status bar in text-* themes, make shownick into something better?
- who list format
- right click context menus
- admin interface?
- nonjs interface needs a few more features...
- fix nonjs - setbackground colour
- @ prefix (in lines like <@user>)
- css for login?
- /quit window.close
- title
- maxlength in input field
- (tom) onbeforeonload = function() { return "Are you sure you want to close CGI:IRC?"; }
                
docs:
- admin password
- remember to update cgiirc-form.txt

Sucky bits of code need rewriting:
- Use more events (slight redesign on Event.pm with global handlers)
- The whole interface thing
- Options
- Formats could be in their own module
- IPv6 handling, most stuff should work with IPv6, but some is messy :(
